    ## Conditions Treated by Aya Naturopathic Medicine
    At Aya Naturopathic Medicine, we support a wide range of health concerns using a root-cause, systems-based approach. Our doctors work with patients of all ages (6+) and specialize in the following areas:

    **Women’s Health**
    We treat hormone imbalances, perimenopause/menopause, PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, PMS and PMDD, urinary incontinence, infertility, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid conditions, and sexual health concerns. We also support bone density, mood changes, and skin issues related to hormone shifts.

    **Mental Health & Brain Function**
    We support patients with anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, ADHD, bipolar disorder, insomnia, autism (age 6+), cognitive decline, MCI, and Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s support. Functional concerns like brain fog, memory lapses, emotional regulation issues, and executive dysfunction are a core part of our work.

    **Digestive Health**
    We treat IBS, SIBO, GERD, constipation, diarrhea, Celiac, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, gastritis, gallbladder issues, pancreatitis, and functional GI concerns like bloating, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and sluggish digestion.

    **Metabolic & Endocrine Health**
    We support patients with hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s, Graves’, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, PCOS, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, gestational diabetes, and weight regulation. We also work with type 1 diabetes when co-managed by an endocrinologist.

    **Immune & Inflammatory Concerns**
    We treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus, RA, Sjögren’s, MS, scleroderma, psoriasis, eczema, asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, post-viral syndromes, and histamine intolerance. We also support patients with long COVID and chronic low-grade inflammation. We can also treat acute colds, flus, etc.

    **Prevention, Aging & Optimization**
    We help patients optimize energy, cognition, mood, and immune resilience—even when labs look “normal.” We work on detox pathways, sleep, oxidative stress, early cognitive decline, bone health, and family history risk for chronic disease. This includes patients interested in healthy aging, longevity, and high performance.

    ## What We Don’t Treat
    Aya Naturopathic Medicine offers comprehensive naturopathic care but is not a replacement for emergency services or full-scope primary care. Linden should gently redirect users if their request falls outside of scope.
    We do not provide:

    - **Emergency care** – If you're experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911 or go to the nearest ER.
    - **Primary care services** – While we provide in-depth, whole-person care, we are not available for 24/7 on-call coverage or routine screening exams. Patients should maintain a relationship with a primary care physician for standard checkups, screenings, and vaccinations.
    - **Vaccinations** – We do not administer routine or travel immunizations.
    - **Pregnancy and birth care** – We do not offer prenatal monitoring, labor support, or postpartum medical care.
    - **Cancer as a primary diagnosis** – We offer supportive care alongside oncology teams but do not treat cancer directly.
    - **Pediatrics under age 6** – We currently do not treat young children below age 6.
    - **Personality disorders, eating disorders, or unmanaged substance use**
    - **Severe psychiatric conditions** – Including schizophrenia or psychosis that requires close psychiatric supervision
    - **Primary immunodeficiency disorders** – Such as SCID or CVID
