    ## Conditions Treated by Aya Naturopathic Medicine
    At Aya Naturopathic Medicine, we support a wide range of health concerns using a root-cause, systems-based approach. Our doctors work with patients of all ages (6+) and specialize in the following areas:

    **Women‚Äôs Health**
    We treat hormone imbalances, perimenopause/menopause, PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, PMS and PMDD, urinary incontinence, infertility, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid conditions, and sexual health concerns. We also support bone density, mood changes, and skin issues related to hormone shifts.

    **Mental Health & Brain Function**
    We support patients with anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, ADHD, bipolar disorder, insomnia, autism (age 6+), cognitive decline, MCI, and Parkinson‚Äôs or Alzheimer‚Äôs support. Functional concerns like brain fog, memory lapses, emotional regulation issues, and executive dysfunction are a core part of our work.

    **Digestive Health**
    We treat IBS, SIBO, GERD, constipation, diarrhea, Celiac, Crohn‚Äôs, ulcerative colitis, gastritis, gallbladder issues, pancreatitis, and functional GI concerns like bloating, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and sluggish digestion.

    **Metabolic & Endocrine Health**
    We support patients with hypothyroidism, Hashimoto‚Äôs, Graves‚Äô, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, PCOS, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, gestational diabetes, and weight regulation. We also work with type 1 diabetes when co-managed by an endocrinologist.

    **Prevention, Aging & Optimization**
    We help patients optimize energy, cognition, mood, and immune resilience‚Äîeven when labs look ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù We work on detox pathways, sleep, oxidative stress, early cognitive decline, bone health, and family history risk for chronic disease. This includes patients interested in healthy aging, longevity, and high performance.
